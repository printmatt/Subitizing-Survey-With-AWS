Subitizing is the mathematical skill of being able to perceive the quantity of small sets of objects or stimuli, without counting.  This research study is looking at what features influence subitizing performance.
<br><br>
Participation will involve looking at different sets of shapes for a fraction of a second and trying to identify how many there were in each set.  There will be a countdown shown before each set, and a distractor screen between sets.  You will be shown approximately 50 sets.  It will only take a few minutes of your time.
<br><br>
You may discontinue your participation at any time for any reason.  Data for unfinished tasks will not be collected.
