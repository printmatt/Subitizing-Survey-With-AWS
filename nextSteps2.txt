Things to Mention:

1.) Barbrina was talking about tweaking each independent variable independently to see how it affects the user's score.
    Could we automate this tweaking process?
	The whole idea of tweaking different variables to optimize for higher scores while preserving difficulty
	reminds me of optimization problems in math an computer science in which independent variables are
	tweaked algorithmically to achieve a desired dependent variable (in this case, high scores on high
	difficulty).
