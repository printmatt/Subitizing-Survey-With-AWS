# subitizationBaseline
 Baseline test for subitization skills.

# Structure
 All client-side code is in the public directory.  Everything else is server-side stuff to test and demonstrate the capability to send the results of the test to a server.

# How to use
 Cloning the public directory and hosting it statically should be good enough.
 
 I tried to use "npm init" to see if I could reproduce the node_modules directory from the package.json file and couldn't seem to get it to work.
 
 However, the server-side code isn't set in stone as of now because we need to work out the logistics of using Adelphi's servers.
