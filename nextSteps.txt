Next Steps:

- Center the interface (done)
- Switch the order of the presented graphics: (done)
	1.) Dot Pattern
	2.) Ask the user how many dots they saw.
	3.) Display the distractor lines.
- Hide the "End the Experiment" button while the dots are on screen. (done)
- Have a dialog confirming if the user wants to end the experiment. (done)
- Aesthetic desicions
	- Button styles (elevated, sunken, etc.)
	- Background colors (done)
- Experiment with Git

Things to Mention:
- I switched the order, but should 3 be before 1?  After the final test case, distractor lines are shown.
- What about displaying the "end the experiment" dialog box during the countdown?
